# ForgeTheFort

### About the Project:

A hub for connecting people in underserved/overlooked cities across the midwest. This hub connects innovators, investors, community leaders, civilians, politicians, etc all in one place to find solutions for their specific problems, connecting people from surrounding districts, counties, cities, and - even - states. The ultimate goal is to provide people with the tools and knowledge to build up their own cities here in the Midwest.
